The next problem is a little bit harder. The source message is not going to be encoded using a single character, but an entire string with length of 10 characters. The first letter is going to be xor-ed with the first character of the keyword, the second letter of the message is xor-ed with the second character of the keyword and so-on. then the eleventh and twenty-first character of the message will also be xor-ed with the first letter of the key. You have to be a little smarter this time since you can't just try all the possible keys since all character combinations are 256^10 = 2^80. Think of some properties of the human language that may help you decode the message.
